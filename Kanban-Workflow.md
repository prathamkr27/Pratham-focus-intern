 Q1 How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
I think kanban boards are a greay way to optimise priorities as it has differnt sections like backlog , not started , in review which gives a clear instruction on which task to priortize first , it also avoid overload as it also has a feature WIP (work in progress) limit which only allows a certain number of tasks to be completed before adding more or moving forward.

Visualisation provides easier understanding of tasks 
WIP limits overloading of work 
Different columns explains a clear instruction on priority ranking
