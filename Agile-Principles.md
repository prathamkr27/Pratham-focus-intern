Q1 What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

- THE BENEFITS
The primary goal of Agile is to reduce the "feedback loop"—the time between doing work and finding out if it was actually what was needed.
In Machine Learning, a model might fail because the data is noisier than expected. In Agile, you find this out in a 2-week Sprint rather than after a 6-month Waterfall phase.
With Daily Stand-ups and Kanban boards, everyone knows exactly what you are working on.

- THE CHALLANGES
As agile welcomes changes , a project might be a never ending proccess if the stakeholder keep adding more features , it might never get to its maintainence stage.
The pressure to deliver something "working" by the end of every two weeks can lead to "quick and dirty" code.

Q2 How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

As i would like to get daily standup and daily feedback on my work i will get the chance to imporve and clear my mistake more ofently , rather waiting for monthly feedbacks

Q3 Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.

Scrum is built around discipline and commitment. The team agrees to a specific amount of work they will finish within a set timeframe (usually 2 weeks), called a Sprint.
Kanban is built around flexibility and efficiency. There are no "sprints" or start/end dates. Work is a constant stream, and you only move to the next task when you have the capacity.

Q4 Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.

Responding to change over following a plan.
