Q1 What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)
While i am working at home i can buy a laptop stand and an external keyboard for my setup so i am working in an ideal height and distance from my screen .

Q2 What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)
I usually work in the swinburne library so i can connect my laptop to the monitor and make it a multi screen setup to reduce stress on my eyes .

Q3 How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)
I will ofcourse use the focus bear app for break sessions which will remind me do deep breathing , i can use those breaks to hydrate my self as well and to correct my posture as well
